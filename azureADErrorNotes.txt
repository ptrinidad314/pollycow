AADSTS50020: User account 'philly999@hotmail.com' from identity provider 'live.com' does 
not exist in tenant 'Default Directory' and cannot access the application 
'1a07a460-363d-47e1-bfee-386ba8101996' in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an 
external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active 
Directory user account.
